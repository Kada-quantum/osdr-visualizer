# OSDR Visualizer
OSDR Visualizer is an AI web application tool that generates flowchart for any [Open Science Data](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr/).
It uses [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) for Open Science Data Repository to retrieve the description which is then summerized by [Llama3.2](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2) and the summery is visually represented into a flowchart.
Flowchart is generated by [flowchart.js](https://flowchart.js.org/) and the web server is hosted using [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask).
